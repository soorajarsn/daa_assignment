# About

This repository contains implementation of searching and sorting algorithms. It has two pdfs in which I have plotted the charts for the best, average and worst case runnig time of different searching and sorting algorithms.

## [Sorting](https://github.com/soorajarsn/searching_sorting_algos/tree/master/sorting)
Implementation of different sorting algorithms.
### [sorting.h](/sorting/sorting.h)
This is a header file, in which I have implemented different sorting algorithms in C language.
### [helper.h](/sorting/helper.h)
I have defined some utility functions in this file. Functions to take input from user, to calculate the time taken by an algorithm, to print output to the console are defined here.
### [sortingCharts.pdf](/sorting/sortingCharts.pdf)
This pdf contains the plots of average case, best case and worst case running times of different sorting algorithms.

## [Searching](../../tree/master/searching)
Implementation of linear search and binary search.
### [searching.java](/searching/searching.java)
This file contains implementation of linear and binary search in java.
### [searchingCharts.pdf](/searching/searchingCharts.pdf)
This pdf contains the plots of average, best and worst case between number of comparisons and input length for binary and linear search.
